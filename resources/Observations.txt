- Between run 2 and run 3, the addition of avoiding Dallas did not
affect the total distance as much as I had thought. For example, getting from
Seattle to Miami with no Dallas restriction took 3318 miles, versus 3451, only
a 133 mile difference.
- Run 4 only had to avoid Dallas, while run 5 avoided Cleveland and Denver, however
we can see that we have to travel for a considerable amount more in Run 5.
Even though Denver is the first stop in every destination for run 4, so is
Dallas for run 5. Surprisingly, Phoenix to Miami, and Phoenix to Houston
were both less distance in the second instance when Dallas was allowed but
Cleveland and Denver were restricted. I suspect that is
because having Dallas as a potential city helps to reduce the amount of
extra travel in order to avoid Dallas, hence why removing just Dallas has
more of an impact that Cleveland and Denver restricted combined.
- Run 6, when traveling from Phoenix to Miami, New York A, and Houston while
avoiding Cleveland, Dallas, and Denver, we have no paths found for all three
destinations. This is due to Phoenix being on the West Coast and all three
destinations on the East Coast, and with the 1000 mile fill up requirement,
not having these three cities in the middle of our route results in no
viable path being found.
