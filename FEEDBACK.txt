FEEDBACK:

Overall, well done in sticking to it this quarter.
	In your future academic endeavors strive to start your projects (whatever they may be)
	on day one. That way you are not rushed in a last minute solution. Instead giving yourself 
	time to be creative!
	
	
Good start to documenting your application. In addition to the new BaseballFileReader 
   class update the documentation for dijkstra() and showDistancesTo() to clarify the
   new modifications.

     
Good comparison of routes, especially observing unreachable ones.
    Yes, if there are too many cities being filtered, there won't be an available path 
	between cities. So some destinations become unreachable.
	
	
-0.5 Incomplete documentation docs generated by Javadocs.
   Generating Javadocs for incomplete documentation is insufficient.

   First, comment your code, especially the new additions to your project,
   in the format required by the Javadocs generator: 
   Then for ease of reference, generate Javadocs based on your documentation.
   For example:
   
    /**
     * Finds shortest path from [description of method].
     * Will find a route that doesn't include [description of update].
     * 
     * @param x Data value of starting vertex.
     * @param citiesToAvoid Vertices that will be skipped in [description of parameter].
     * @return True if a path was found, false otherwise.
     */
    public boolean dijkstra(E x, ArrayList<E> citiesToAvoid) 
	{
        FHvertex<E> w, s, v;

   NOTE: An example is provided in Modules titled "Example Program Submission".

-Bita.
